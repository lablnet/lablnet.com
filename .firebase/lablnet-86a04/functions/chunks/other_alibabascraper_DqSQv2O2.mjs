However, it began with an Alibaba scraper. Due to high proxy costs, the client couldn't afford it, and I had to discontinue the project. After completing the Alibaba scraper, I released it as open-source. This script can scrape the entire Alibaba site, a process that would take approximately 4-6 months.\n\n### Features\n- Scrape data from Alibaba website\n- Multi-threaded\n- Save data to Amazon DynamoDB\n- Proxy support\n- Proper error handling and logging\n\n## Lessons Learned\nHaving worked on numerous scraping projects before, I didn't encounter any new technical challenges. However, I learned the importance of communicating with clients about additional costs that may arise during a project.\n\n## Future Thoughts\nI have released this project as open-source, and I welcome anyone to use and contribute to it. I would be delighted if someone finds it useful and decides to build upon it.\n";
