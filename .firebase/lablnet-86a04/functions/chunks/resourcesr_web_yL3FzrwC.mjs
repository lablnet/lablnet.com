I was able to compile the Flutter app to web, but it was very slow. Therefore, I developed the app in VueJs to improve its performance.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\n1. Sharing of class resources such as lectures, assignments, and quizzes.\r\n2. Viewing of today's events.\r\n3. Only class representatives or management can manage and update resources.\r\n\r\n### Issues Faced\r\n\r\n1. The same challenges as the previous project, including difficulty in maintaining resources and issues with Firebase functions.\r\n\r\n### Some Goodies\r\n\r\n1. I added additional features for admin users, such as the ability to add resources.\r\n\r\n### Lessons Learnt\r\n\r\nThis was my first time using Firebase as a database, and I learned about its capabilities through this project.\r\n";
