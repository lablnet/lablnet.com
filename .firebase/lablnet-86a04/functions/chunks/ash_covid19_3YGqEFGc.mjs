Instead of retrieving data from the server, we can create static JavaScript files directly and host them on GitHub and create a static site with VueJs.\n- So, I made it a success with GitHub Actions [by the way, thanks to GitHub for providing the best functionality].\n- The second problem I faced was about enabling frontend sites to support multiple countries but I solved it.\n\n### Features\n- Automated parsing of data from government websites daily using GitHub Actions for multiple countries.\n- Automated parsing of data from WHO on every Monday using GitHub Actions.\n- Dashboard to visualize data.\n- Publicly available data downloading.\n- Support for multiple countries on the frontend.\n- Super Fast performance.\n- Fully customizable for country websites - see the contribution guideline for more information.\n\n### Some Goodies\n- Simple and easy-to-use UI for discovering COVID-19 statistics.\n- Easily portable to multiple countries by adding a new scraper and frontend support.\n- Highly scalable and fast.\n- Publicly available data.\n- I enjoyed working in it.\n\n### Lessons Learnt\nAlthough, this was my first project using the selenium and beautiful-soup libraries, so I learned about them along with GitHub Actions.\n";
