I am currently using shared hosting. ðŸ˜”\r\n\r\n\r\n### Lessons Learnt\r\nThis was one of the first web apps I developed that utilized tailwindCSS, and it was a great learning experience. I now plan to use tailwindCSS in all of my future projects.\r\n\r\n### Future Thoughts\r\nThe blog functionality does not currently work as intended, and I would like to improve it. I also want to add a login system for users to manage their orders.\r\n";
