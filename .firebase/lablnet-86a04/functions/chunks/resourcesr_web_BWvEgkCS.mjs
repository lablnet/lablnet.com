I was able to compile the Flutter app to web, but it was very slow. Therefore, I developed the app in VueJs to improve its performance.\n\n### Features\n\n1. Sharing of class resources such as lectures, assignments, and quizzes.\n2. Viewing of today's events.\n3. Only class representatives or management can manage and update resources.\n\n### Issues Faced\n\n1. The same challenges as the previous project, including difficulty in maintaining resources and issues with Firebase functions.\n\n### Some Goodies\n\n1. I added additional features for admin users, such as the ability to add resources.\n\n### Lessons Learnt\n\nThis was my first time using Firebase as a database, and I learned about its capabilities through this project.\n";
