The goal of the app was to help users find the best business partners by allowing them to log in and search for potential partners based on various criteria. I was responsible for the entire development process, from conceptualization to deployment, and was able to deliver a high-quality product that met the client's needs and expectations. This project allowed me to gain valuable experience in developing mobile applications, and I was pleased to be able to contribute to the success of Icontem.\n";
