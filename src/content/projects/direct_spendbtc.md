### Purpose
This project involved the development of an Amazon gift buying site that allowed users to make purchases using various cryptocurrencies. This was a new challenge for me, as it was the first time I had developed a custom theme and plugins for WordPress. The project was initiated when a man from Japan contacted me directly and hired me for the job. Despite the challenges, I was able to successfully complete the project, resulting in a fully functional and user-friendly website. This experience allowed me to expand my skillset and broaden my expertise in WordPress development.
