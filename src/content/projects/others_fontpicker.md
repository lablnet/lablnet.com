### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a standalone font picker for the web. The font picker will allow users to quickly preview and select fonts from Google's large range of free fonts. Users will be able to select a font family, as well as optional font weight and style (normal or italics).

### Features
- Quickly preview and select any Google font family.
- Optionally choose font weight and font style.

### Todo
- Find fonts by name, language, and category (serif, sans-serif, display, handwriting, monospace).
- Update style to make it mobile responsive.
