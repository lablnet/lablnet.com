### Purpose
As a freelancer on Upwork, I developed this tool to help visualize and track my earnings and other statistics. I am publishing it for others to use as well. Upwork does not provide charts or graphs showing earnings or statistics. -14 April, 2021, so this project aims to provide that functionality.

### Features
- Shows charts of earnings and other statistics.
- No server involvement is required.
