As a freelancer on Upwork, I developed this tool to help visualize and track my earnings and other statistics. I am publishing it for others to use as well. Upwork does not provide charts or graphs showing earnings or statistics. -14 April, 2021, so this project aims to provide that functionality.
I started to improve the project on 2nd Feb, 2024 in my free time.
