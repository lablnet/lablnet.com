### Purpose
The main purpose of this project was to create a website for my registered company, AlphaSoftHub (Private) Limited.

### Problems Faced
I initially wanted the backend of the system to be in Python, but I was unable to host it because I could not afford a dedicated server. I am currently using shared hosting. ðŸ˜”


### Lessons Learnt
This was one of the first web apps I developed that utilized tailwindCSS, and it was a great learning experience. I now plan to use tailwindCSS in all of my future projects.

### Future Thoughts
The blog functionality does not currently work as intended, and I would like to improve it. I also want to add a login system for users to manage their orders.
