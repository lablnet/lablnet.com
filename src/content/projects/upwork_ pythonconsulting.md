Consulting with a client in Germany on the use of Python, Flask, and Firebase was an impressive and exciting experience. The project involved debugging issues and providing guidance on how to identify and solve future issues. I recommended using a hypothesis-driven approach, in which we develop a hypothesis about the cause of the problem and then use a divide-and-conquer strategy to systematically address each step. This approach proved to be effective, and the client was able to successfully resolve the issues with the project. Overall, it was a rewarding experience to be able to provide valuable guidance to the client and help them overcome challenges with their project.
