### Purpose

The purpose of this web app is similar to the previous project, but with a faster and more efficient design. I was able to compile the Flutter app to web, but it was very slow. Therefore, I developed the app in VueJs to improve its performance.

### Features

1. Sharing of class resources such as lectures, assignments, and quizzes.
2. Viewing of today's events.
3. Only class representatives or management can manage and update resources.

### Issues Faced

1. The same challenges as the previous project, including difficulty in maintaining resources and issues with Firebase functions.

### Some Goodies

1. I added additional features for admin users, such as the ability to add resources.

### Lessons Learnt

This was my first time using Firebase as a database, and I learned about its capabilities through this project.
