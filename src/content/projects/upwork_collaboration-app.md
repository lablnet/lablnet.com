I am currently working on a project called Collaboration App. Collaboration App is a web application that allows users to collaborate with each other. I am developing this project using Vue, TailwindCSS, and Firebase. The features of this project as follow:

1. Admin will invite user to join the app.
2. Admin can create another admin, user, room, and assign user to room.
3. User can join the room and chat with other user in the same room.
    a. User can send text message.
    b. User can send image.
    c. User can send file.

4. Admin can create Zoom meeting or sechdule before meeting.
5. User can join the Zoom meeting from the app.
6. The Zoom meeting should be inside the app by using Zoom SDK.

### Lessons Learned
- I learned how to integrate Zoom SDK into the web application.
- I learned how to use Firebase Functions to create Zoom meeting and join the meeting.
- I learned how to use Firebase storage to store the image and file.
