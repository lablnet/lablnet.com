I am currently working on a project called Collaboration App. Collaboration App is a web application that allows users to collaborate with each other. I am developing this project using Vue, TailwindCSS, and Firebase. The features of this project as follow:

- Admin will invite user to join the app.
- Admin can create another admin, user, room, and assign user to room.
- User can join the room and chat with other user in the same room.
    - User can send text message.
    - User can send image.
    - User can send file.
- Admin can create Zoom meeting or sechdule before meeting.
- User can join the Zoom meeting from the app.
- The Zoom meeting should be inside the app by using Zoom SDK.

### Lessons Learned
- I learned how to integrate Zoom SDK into the web application.
- I learned how to use Firebase Functions to create Zoom meeting and join the meeting.
- I learned how to use Firebase storage to store the image and file.
