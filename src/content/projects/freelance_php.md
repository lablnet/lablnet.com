### Purpose
The project involved extracting data from a MySQL database using PHP. While the overall project was relatively simple, the MySQL queries required to complete it were quite complex. However, I was able to successfully configure and execute the queries, and I was able to extract the necessary data from the database. This allowed me to complete the project successfully, and I gained valuable experience working with complex MySQL queries in the process. Overall, I was pleased with the successful completion of this project.
