### Purpose
The primary objective is to develop a chatbot website that allows users to interact with a bot for various actions, including retrieving and storing information. This system aims to facilitate user-bot interactions in a structured and efficient manner.

### Features
1. **User Authentication**: Secure login functionality.
2. **Interactive Chatbot**: Utilizes OpenAI's APIs for natural language processing.
3. **Action Selection**: Users can choose actions by typing.
4. **Database Interaction**: Capability to read and write data to a cloud database.
5. **Admin Panel**: For database management and oversight.
6. **Scalability**: Able to serve 1000+ concurrent users.
7. **Real-Time Updates**: Display live data from the database.


## Challenges
Prompt engineering is a new field that is still in its infancy. As such, there are many challenges that we will face during the development of this project. Some of the major ones are listed below:
    - **Natural Language Processing**: The chatbot will need to be able to understand and respond to user queries.
        - The queries can be like "I want to vote on rule 2" or "I want to vote on rule 2 with as netural".
        - The bot will need to be able to understand the intent of the user and respond accordingly.

## Good Practices
- **Efficient Database Design**: To facilitate quick reads/writes.
- **Robust Error Handling**: For a smooth user experience.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring compatibility across different devices.
- **Regular Testing**: To identify and fix issues promptly.

### Lessons Learned
- Learned how to use OpenAI's APIs for natural language processing and prompt engineering.

### Deliverables
1. **Complete Website**: Deployed and functional within 1-2 weeks.
2. **Documentation**: Covering usage and maintenance.
3. **Source Code**: With proper documentation for future modifications.
