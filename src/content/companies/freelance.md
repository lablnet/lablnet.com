While I have only completed one project on freelancer.com, I quickly realized that this platform is rife with scams and spam. This was a disappointing discovery, as it made it difficult for me to trust the legitimacy of the opportunities available on the site. Despite this, I was able to successfully complete the project I was working on, and I gained valuable experience in the process. However, I decided to explore other freelance platforms in order to avoid the scams and spam that are prevalent on freelancer.com.
